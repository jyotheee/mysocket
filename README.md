# playWithRTC:
=============

playWithRTC is an exploration of realtime communication/colloboration across devices using webRTC protocol. Ever since I moved to the US, I've predominantly used technology to stay in touch with friends and family abroad. I wanted to learn more about how such products are built. From my online research and talks at the GoogleIO conference, I learnt about the capabilities & applications of WebRTC. I decided to build a webapp that would enable a classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe across devices in realtime.

WebRTC is a definition drafted by WorldWideWeb Consortium to enable peer-to-peer applications for voice calling, video chat and point-to-point file sharing. Applications can be developed using standard web environments such as Javascript APIs, HTML5 and do not require download and installation of plugins.
